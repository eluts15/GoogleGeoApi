# GeoLocationApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

This projects implements the Google Geocoding api.  The full documentation can be found at:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start

## Specification

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.
Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address. The Google Maps Geocoding API's reverse geocoding service also lets you find the address for a given place ID.

Input Latitide: 33.3632256, Input Logitude: -117.0874871
Output is the Physical Address, in this case, output is: 11271-11399 CA-76, Pala, CA 92059, USA

You can also type in the physical address and get back the associated latitude and longitude!
For example, by typing in the address, 11271-11399 CA-76, Pala, CA 92059, USA, you should expect to get the respective coodinates.
